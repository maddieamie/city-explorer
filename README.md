# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## City Explorer Class Lab

**Author**: Maddie Lewis
**Version**: 1.0.2 for Lab 06

## Overview

This is a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for data from a third-party API. I am using LocationIQ to make requests for this assignment. You can enter a location to see its latitude and longitude, as well as a map of the area. You could also check the weather at that location, as well as movies about the location. The application should provide feedback as the user interacts in the form of success and error messages.

## Getting Started

In order for this application to run, you will need to install Vite, React Bootstrap, and Axios. Otherwise, you can just go to the deployed link. 

## Architecture

This app was built in Vite React App, with Axios. It also utilizes the React Bootstrap library. LocationIQ provided the API response data. 

## Change Log

10-12-2023 20:00  - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
10-14-2023 12:30  - Application ReadME updated with diagram and information. 
10-14-2023 17:11 - Application is now updated with map, CSS, and error display for lab 06.
